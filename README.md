### About me
I am a Ph.D. student in Applied Economics and a Sea Grant Fellow specializing in Marine Resource Economics. My research focuses on understanding the economic impacts of environmental changes on fisheries. I explore how marine heatwaves and algal blooms affect West Coast fisheries, as well as how offshore wind farm development and rising water temperatures influence East Coast fisheries. Through my work, I aim to provide insights that support sustainable fisheries management and coastal economies in a changing climate.
